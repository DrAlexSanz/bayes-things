        "Here's what we have so far:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Theorem 1** gives us a way to compute a conditional probability using a conjunction:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A~\\mathrm{and}~B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Theorem 2** gives us a way to compute a conjunction using a conditional probability:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A~\\mathrm{and}~B) = P(B) P(A|B)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Theorem 3**, also known as Bayes's Theorem, gives us a way to get from $P(A|B)$ to $P(B|A)$, or the other way around:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A) P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Law of Total Probability** provides a way to compute probabilities by adding up the pieces:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(A) = \\sum_i P(B_i) P(A|B_i)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point you might ask, \"So what?\"  If we have all of the data, we can compute any probability we want, any conjunction, or any conditional probability, just by counting.  We don't have to use these formulas.\n",
        "\n",
        "And you are right, *if* we have all of the data.  But often we don't, and in that case, these formulas can be pretty useful -- especially Bayes's Theorem.\n",
        "In the next chapter, we'll see how."
